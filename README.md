This Java program provides a console-based utility for basic file operations, leveraging java.io classes like BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileReader, and FileWriter. It allows users to write content to a file, read content from a file, and modify specific text within a file, offering a practical demonstration of file handling in Java. The program uses a user-friendly menu-driven approach and employs try-with-resources for efficient resource management. It is compatible with JDK 8 and above and can be developed using IDEs like  Eclipse. Suitable for educational purposes and lightweight text management tasks, the code can be extended for additional features like appending text, handling concurrency, or integrating a GUI. This simple yet versatile tool highlights modular design and Java's core functionalities.
